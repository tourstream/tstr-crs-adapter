## Contributing to CRS Adapter

#### Did you find a bug?

If you already know a solution please fix it, create a test and a pull request. 

If not, let us now due creating an issue for the problem. 
This issue should describe how to replay the bug and what is expected instead.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Please create a test and a pull request and include a description of what your change is intended to do.
Refer to the questions "What I want to reach with that change?"

Finally: you do not have to create the dist files!

#### You are a release manager of this repository?

You have to create new versions - the recommended way: `npm version <version-number>`!
This process will create the dist files and update the version of the library.
We use semantic versioning - think about it before setting it!
